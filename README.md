# Hybrid Quadruped Robot with Wheeled Locomotion for Terrain Navigation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and development of a hybrid quadruped robot integrated with wheeled locomotion for efficient terrain navigation. The robot combines the stability of legged locomotion with the speed and efficiency of wheels.

Objectives
- Design a stable quadruped robotic structure
- Integrate wheeled locomotion mechanism
- Develop control algorithms for terrain adaptability
- Improve mobility over uneven and rough surfaces

Technologies Used
- Robotics & Automation Principles
- Embedded Systems
- Motor Control & Actuators
- Sensors Integration
- (Add: ROS / Arduino / Python / MATLAB if used)

System Architecture
The system consists of:
- Mechanical frame and leg assembly
- Wheel integration mechanism
- Control unit (Microcontroller/Processor)
- Power system
- Sensor modules

Working Principle
The robot operates in two locomotion modes:
1. Legged walking mode for rough terrain
2. Wheeled mode for smooth and fast navigation

The control algorithm switches between modes based on terrain conditions.

Results
- Improved mobility over mixed terrain
- Increased energy efficiency during wheeled mode
- Stable gait performance during walking mode

Future Scope
- AI-based terrain classification
- Autonomous navigation using Computer Vision
- Real-time obstacle avoidance
