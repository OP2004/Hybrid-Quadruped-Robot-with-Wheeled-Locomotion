# Hybrid Quadruped Robot with Wheeled Locomotion for Terrain Navigation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and development of a hybrid quadruped robot integrated with wheeled locomotion for efficient terrain navigation. The robot combines the stability of legged locomotion with the speed and efficiency of wheels.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a stable quadruped robotic structure
- Integrate wheeled locomotion mechanism
- Develop control algorithms for terrain adaptability
- Improve mobility over uneven and rough surfaces

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Robotics & Automation Principles
- Embedded Systems
- Motor Control & Actuators
- Sensors Integration
- (Add: ROS / Arduino / Python / MATLAB if used)

## ⚙ System Architecture
The system consists of:
- Mechanical frame and leg assembly
- Wheel integration mechanism
- Control unit (Microcontroller/Processor)
- Power system
- Sensor modules

## 🧠 Working Principle
The robot operates in two locomotion modes:
1. Legged walking mode for rough terrain
2. Wheeled mode for smooth and fast navigation

The control algorithm switches between modes based on terrain conditions.

## 📊 Results
